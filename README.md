ABOUT
As a full-time Residential, Investment Property and Commercial Realtor serving the greater Pittsburgh area , I welcome the opportunity to provide you with stellar service as you buy or sell. Beginning in 2001, I've supported hundreds of clients with their first home or investment. And now many are returning to sell and move or reinvest. Single Family Residences (SFR), Multi-Family Residences (MFR) and even smaller commercial property transactions are in my tool box.
 
My 30+ years in sales in the corporate world enhance my capabilities to understand the "big picture" of a real estate transaction while seeing the details and the emotions involved in purchasing or selling your home. Your family's goals are mine! And if you're an investor looking for your first duplex, or a seasoned professional expanding your portfolio, I have a unique perspective most agents don't have, so I help you see past the emotional and go for the financial impact of investing or reinvesting. My team stands ready to go to work for you.
 
Every real estate venture is different. Whether it's your home, your business or investments it all adds up to your future. Trust your real estate investment with an experienced Realtor who takes time to understand you and your needs.

Pittsburgh is a hot real estate investment market...just ask any of my clients.  Other cities have seen extremely high purchase prices while Pittsburgh remains a more cost-effective alternative with better buy-ins and greater return on investment.  Pittsburgh has also been dubbed as the 2nd "Silicon Valley" with it's tech influence largely funded by big named companies such as Amazon, Apple, Argo AI and Uber who have set up shop here. It already has a world renowned medical presence and technological advancements that have been supported by a comprehensive higher education system largely supported by CMU, Pitt and many others. Our proactive Mayor and County Executive have and continue to spearhead many initiatives slated for continued growth.  As a result, many city and suburban areas are seeing strong revitalization.  And neighborhoods are being upgraded to reflect that growth!
 
The trick, of course, is to get into those areas ahead of the rest, before they explode.  Many investors have asked my team for assistance in finding those "up and coming" neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.  I have lived here my whole life so I know the area and market very well.  I continue to work with many investors, both local and remote to the area, in various real estate investment transactions including Buy and Hold, Multifamily, Remodel/Rehab (Flips) and Small Commercial Properties. I'm proud to support you in finding the type of investment property that works best for you. And when it comes time to sell your existing property, my team is here for you.
