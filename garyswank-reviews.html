Nearly 100 forms needed signed and we never broke a sweat, as he took care of everything smoothly and accurately. When we listed our project on the market, Gary had professional pictures taken of each room, along with a detailed description of the house. Needless to say, our home was on the market for a total of three days before we accepted an offer.
